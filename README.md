# edge_coupled_cpwg

Impedance calculator for conductor-backed edge coupled coplanar waveguides



A simple and very efficient calculator of a differential pair impedance in a specific scenario, shown in ascii-art below.

The reason for creating this tool is I failed to find any other (free and open source) alternative. Certainly built-in KiCad calculators can't handle this case.

Simulations suggest this may be a viable way of routing proper, impedance matched differential pairs on any cheap, 2-layer prototype grade PCBs, such as offered by JLCPCB or OSH Park.

### Building and installation

This program is written in C++. In order to build it, GNU g++ 6.0 or above is required along with standard `cmath` library, or any other compiler that knows what `std::comp_ellint_1` is. Tested on Linux.

```
make
sudo make install
```



### Accuracy of the results

The formule and methodology implemented in this program has been created by far greater minds than my own, and described in source literature. I cannot claim I understand how this works and cannot make any claims about the performance of this software.

However, the same setup has been simulated using commercial `Si9000` and open-source `atlc`. The latter allows for simulation with any degree of precision that I classified by input bitmap size in bytes. Larger bitmaps contain more details, both in terms of input and intermediate simulation data, however simulation time quickly gets unbearable.

These are the results for selected programs, all with the same input data:
